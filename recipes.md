## Empanadas

### Ingredients
* 3 C Flour
* 1 tsp Salt

## Tortillas de Maíz

### Ingredients

* 2 C Nixtamalized corn flour
* 400 ml Water

### Preparation

1. Put the corn flour in a bowl and add 250ml of water. Mix well until all the water is absorbed. After doing this you will end up with a dry dough.

1. Little by little add the remaining water until you get a dough with the consistency similar to playdoh. You might not need all of it or you might even need a bit more.

1. Make a ball about the size of a golf ball (may be smaller or larger depending on the size of the tortillas that you want).

1. Put a sheet of plastic (cut out plastic bags from the supermarket's produce section work great for this) on your tortilla press, then a ball of dough and a second sheet of plastic on top. Close the tortilla press and press hard until you get a tortilla of about 1mm thick.

1. Peel the top plastic sheet off and then put the tortilla on your hand. Peel the second plastic sheet off.

1. Gently place the tortilla on a preheated comal or a non-stick pan. Cook for 15 to 20 seconds then turn.

1. Cook for one and a half more minutes or until the tortilla starts to brown, then turn it again. The tortilla should puff.

1. Keep cooking while it puffs until it browns a bit on that side.

1. Remove from the pan and put in a basket or between two kitchen towels. This will keep the tortillas warm while letting them breathe at the same time. Tortilla containers that are fully sealed are not good since they don't let any moisture out.

## Cemitas Poblanas

### Ingredients

* 2 C Flour
* 1 C Warm water
* 1.5 tsp Dry active yeast
* 1 tsp Salt
* 1.5 C Lard
* 4 Pork chops
* 250 gr Oaxaca cheese
* 2 Avocados
* 2 Tbsp Flour
* 2 Tbsp Milk
* 2 Eggs
* Sesame seeds
* Breadcrumbs
* Chipotles in adobo sauce
* Pápalo
* Olive oil
* Salt
* Pepper

### Preparation

1. Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in lukewarm water and let it rest for about 10 minutes.

1. Add the salt to the flour and with your hands mix in the lard until well incorporated. Slowly add the water to the flour and mix. Knead the dough for about 15 minutes until it becomes soft.

1. Cover the inside of a bowl with a few drops of olive oil and put the dough in. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest overnight.

1. Punch the dough down and knead it for a few minutes. Cut the dough into four pieces and form them into balls. Let them rest for about half hour.

1. Brush the tops with water and sprinkle the sesame seeds. Add a few drops of olive oil on a baking tray and evenly place the cemitas. Preheat the oven to 450F and bake until golden brown. Let them cool down before filling.

1. Use a meat hammer to pound the pork chops as thinly as possible. It helps if you slice the chops first. I was able to get three or four slices from a single chop.

1. Set out 3 shallow bowls. Add the flour to the first one. On the second one add the milk, eggs and salt and whisk them together. Put the breadcrumbs on the third bowl.

1. Heat olive oil on a large skillet over medium heat.

1. Dredge the cutlets first in the flour, then dip them in the egg mixture, and then into the bread crumbs. Sauté them for three or four minutes on each side. Once done, use a couple of napkins to remove the excess oil.

1. Unroll the Oaxaca cheese and separate it into thin threads.

1. Slice the cemitas in half. Add lots of avocado slices to the bottom half. Put the pork chop on top and then the cheese... as much as you can fit in there. Add more avocado slices on top of the cheese. Add salt, a few papalo leaves, chipotle and olive oil.

1. Pápalo is indispensable for cemitas. I'm not able to find it at my local grocery store or farmer's market so I had to grow my own. You can buy the seeds from Johnny's Seeds.

## Hummus

### Ingredients

* 2 Cups Dried chickpeas
* 1/4 Cup Tahini
* 1 Garlic clove
* 3 Limes (juice)
* Water
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 2 tsp Salt

### Preparation

1. Soak the chickpeas overnight.
1. Drain the chickpeas and rinse them with water.
1. Put the chickpeas in a pan over medium heat. Add the baking soda and one tablespoon of water. Stir frequently until the water has evaporated. Rinse the chickpeas thoroughly to remove all the baking soda.
1. Put the chickpeas in a pot over high heat and cover with water. Add the salt. Once the water starts to boil remove all the scum. Lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to one hour or until the chickpeas are extremely soft.
1. Drain the chickpeas and let them cool down but don't let them get too dry. Put the cooked chickpeas, tahini, garlic, lime juice and salt in a bowl and blend with an immersion blender. Add water as necessary to get the desired consistency. Add more salt if needed.


<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"></div>


## Israeli Hummus

### Ingredients

* 1 C Dried chickpeas
* 2 tsp Baking soda, divided
* 2 Cloves garlic
* 2 Bay leaves
* 1.5 C Tahini sauce with garlic and lemon
* Kosher salt
* Olive oil
* 1 Small onion, halved
* 1 Small stalk celery
* 1 Small carrot
* Za'atar
* Paprika
* Chopped fresh parsley leaves

### Preparation

1. Combine beans, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 2 tablespoons salt in a large bowl and cover with 6 cups cold water. Stir to dissolve salt and baking soda. Let stand at room temperature overnight. Drain and rinse beans thoroughly.

1. Place beans in a large Dutch oven or saucepan. Add remaining baking soda, 1 tablespoon salt, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and bay leaves. Add 6 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover with lid slightly cracked, and cook until beans are completely tender, to the point of falling apart, about 2 hours. Check on beans occasionally and top up with more water if necessary, they should be completely submerged at all times.

1. Discard onion, celery, and bay leaves. Transfer chickpeas, carrot, and garlic to a food processor or high-powered blender (such as a Vitamix, BlendTec or Breville Boss)(see note above) with enough cooking liquid to barely cover them. Cover blender, taking out the central insert on the blender lid. Place a folded kitchen towel over the hole in the center of the lid to allow steam to escape. Holding the towel down firmly, turn the blender to the lowest possible speed and slowly increase speed to high. If the mixture becomes too thick to blend, add cooking liquid until it has the texture of a very thick milkshake, always starting the blender on low speed before increasing to high. If your blender comes with a push-stick for thick purees, use it. Continue blending until completely smooth, about 2 minutes.

1. Transfer hot chickpea mixture to a large bowl. Whisk in tahini sauce. Whisk in salt to taste. Transfer to a sealed container and allow to cool to room temperature. It should thicken up until it can hold its shape when spooned onto a plate.

1. Serve hummus on a wide, shallow plate, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with za'atar, paprika, whole warm chickpeas, and/or chopped parsley. Leftover hummus can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Allow to come to room temperature before serving.

# Bread

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"></div>


## NYT No-knead bread

### Ingredients

* 3 cups/385 grams all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting
* 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* Cornmeal or wheat bran, as needed

### Preparation

1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 5/8 cups water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.

1. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.

1. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

1. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

## The Chocolate Cake

### Ingredients

* 1 1/8 C Unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch processed)
* 3/4 C Whole milk
* 3 tsp Vanilla
* 3 C Flour
* 2 tsp Baking soda
* 1.5 C Unsalted butter, softened
* 1.5 C Dark brown sugar
* 1.5 C Granulated sugar
* 6 Eggs
* 3/4 tsp Salt

### Frosting

* 5 oz Unsweetened chocolate
* 3/4 C Unsalted butter
* 1 C Whipped cream cheese
* 2 tsp Vanilla
* 2 C Confectioners' sugar

### Preparation

1. This is THE chocolate cake. There are no others. Just this one.

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter two large rectangular baking pans (13 by 9 by 2 inches) and line them with waxed or parchment paper. Butter the paper and dust the pans with cocoa (you could use flour, but cocoa adds colour and flavour).

1. Measure the cocoa powder into a bowl, and whisk in 1 1/2 cups of boiling water until it is smooth, dark and so glossy it reminds you of chocolate pudding. Whisk in the milk and vanilla. In another bowl, whisk the flour with the baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon salt.

1. Put the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer and beat in the sugars until it is light, fluffy and the color of coffee with cream (about 5 minutes). One at a time, add the eggs, beating for about 20 seconds after each before adding the next. On low speed, beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches and the cocoa mixture in 2, alternating flour-cocoa-flour-cocoa-flour.

1. Pour half of the batter into each pan and smooth the tops. Bake in the middle of the oven until a tester comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Let the pans rest on cooling racks for 2 minutes, then turn the cakes onto racks to cool completely before frosting.

1. Make the frosting: Chop the chocolate and melt it in a double boiler. Let it cool so that you can comfortably put your finger in it. While it’s cooling, mix the butter with the whipped cream cheese. Add the chocolate, the vanilla and a dash of salt, and mix in the confectioners’ sugar until it looks like frosting, at least 5 minutes. Assemble the cake, spreading about a third of the frosting on one of the cooled layers, then putting the second layer on top and frosting the assembled cake.
