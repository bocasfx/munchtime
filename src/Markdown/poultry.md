## <a name="Baked Chicken"></a> Baked Chicken

### Ingredients

* 1 chicken, cut into 6 parts (2 breasts, 2 thighs & legs, 2 wings), excluding the back.
* Olive oil
* Salt

### Preparation

1. Trim the chicken pieces of excess fat. Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle all sides with salt. Let the chicken pieces sit for 15 to 20 minutes to take the chill off.

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C)

1. Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Rub olive oil over the chicken pieces and on the bottom of the roasting pan.

1. Sprinkle the chicken pieces all over with black pepper and a little more salt.

1. Arrange the chicken pieces in the pan so that all the pieces are skin-side up, and the largest pieces (the breasts) are in the center of the pan. Don't crowd the pan; allow room in between the pieces.


1. Bake (uncovered) in the oven for 30 minutes at 400°F (205°C). This initial high heat will help brown the chicken. Then lower the heat to 350°F (175°C) and bake for an additional 10-30 minutes until the juices run clear (not pink) when poked with a sharp knife or the internal temperature of the chicken breasts is 165°F (74°C), and of the thighs is 170°F (77°C) when tested with a meat thermometer.

1. If the chicken isn't browning well enough, place the chicken under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking, until browned sufficiently.

1. Remove from oven and transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
