### Ingredients

* 3 cups/385 grams all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting
* 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* Cornmeal or wheat bran, as needed

### Preparation

1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 5/8 cups water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.

1. Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.

1. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.

1. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, then remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Cool on a rack.

## <a name="Cemitas Poblanas (traditional recipe)"></a> Cemitas Poblanas (traditional recipe)

### Ingredients bread

* 1Kg All purpose flour
* 700ml Water
* 10gr Salt
* 3gr Barley malt powder
* 10 gr yeast

### Ingredients "atole"

* 250 ml Water
* 10 gr Sugar
* 8 gr corn starch

### Procedure

1. Combine the flour, salt, malt powder and yeast. Slowly add the water and knead the dough. This is a 70% hydration dough so it will be quite sticky.
1. Continue kneading until the dough is a bit more manageable and let it rest until it doubles in size.
1. Lightly flour your working surface so the dough doesn't stick and divide it into balls of about 80 to 100 grams.
1. Take one dough ball and press it down using the outer edge of your hand moving it back and forth until it's shaped like a number 8 with the lower section slightly bigger than the upper one. Continue shaping the rest of the balls and let them rest.
1. Take each of the 8-shaped balls and flatten them with the palm of your hand. Take the smaller part, give it a 180 degree twist and place it on top of the bigger section. Press it down with the palm of your hand. Continue shaping the rest of the balls and let them rest until they puff up.
1. To make the corn starch wash (atole) combine water, sugar and cornstarch in a pot and bring to a boil. Let it cool down to room temperature.
1. Once the cemitas have risen cover them lightly with the corn starch wash (atole) using a brush. Let them rest until the wash has dried. Repeat the process and add sesame seeds before the wash dries.
1. Preheat your oven to 450f and put a tray with boiling water in it so it provides moisture while the cemitas are baking.
1. Bake them for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden brown.

### Levain

* 30g medium-protein bread flour
* 30g whole wheat flour
* 60g water
* 30g ripe sourdough starter

### Main Dough

* 822g medium-protein bread flour
* 64g whole wheat flour
* 745g water
* 17g salt
* 151g ripe levain

### Procedure

1. **Levain (9:00 a.m.)**: In a small container, mix the levain ingredients and keep at 78°F (25°C) for 5 hours.
1. **Autolyse (12:00 p.m)**: In a medium mixing bowl, add 822g medium-protein bread flour, 64g whole wheat flour, 650g water, and mix until no dry bits remain. Cover the bowl and let rest for 2 hours.
1. **Mix (2:00 p.m.)**:To the mixing bowl holding your dough, add 95g water (holding back any as necessary if the dough is too wet), 17g sea salt, and the ripe levain (from step 1). Transfer your dough to a bulk fermentation container and cover.
1. **Bulk Fermentation (2:15 p.m. to 6:15 p.m.)**: Give the dough 6 sets of stretch and folds. The first three sets are at 15-minute intervals, and the last three sets are at 30-minute intervals.
1. **Divide and Preshape (6:15 p.m.)**: Lightly flour your work surface and scrape out your dough. Using your bench knife, divide the dough in half. Lightly shape each half into a round shape. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes, uncovered.
1. **Shape (6:45 p.m.)**: Shape the dough into a round (boule) or oval (batard) and place it in proofing baskets. Cover the baskets with a reusable plastic bag.
1. **Proof (7:25 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. the next day)**: Cover proofing baskets with reusable plastic and seal them shut. Then, place both baskets into the refrigerator and proof overnight.
1. **Bake (Preheat oven at 8:00 a.m., bake at 9:00 a.m.)**: Preheat your oven with a combo cooker or Dutch oven inside to 450°F (230°C). Remove your dough from the fridge, score it, and transfer it to the preheated combo cooker. Place the cooker in the oven, cover with the lid, and bake for 20 minutes. After this time, remove the lid (you can keep it in the oven or remove it) and continue to bake for 30 minutes longer. When done, the internal temperature should be around 208°F (97°C). Let the loaves cool for 2 hours on a wire rack before slicing.
