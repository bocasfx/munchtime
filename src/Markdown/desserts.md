## The Chocolate Cake

### Ingredients

* 1 1/8 C Unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch processed)
* 3/4 C Whole milk
* 3 tsp Vanilla
* 3 C Flour
* 2 tsp Baking soda
* 1.5 C Unsalted butter, softened
* 1.5 C Dark brown sugar
* 1.5 C Granulated sugar
* 6 Eggs
* 3/4 tsp Salt

### Frosting

* 5 oz Unsweetened chocolate
* 3/4 C Unsalted butter
* 1 C Whipped cream cheese
* 2 tsp Vanilla
* 2 C Confectioners' sugar

### Preparation

1. This is THE chocolate cake. There are no others. Just this one.

1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter two large rectangular baking pans (13 by 9 by 2 inches) and line them with waxed or parchment paper. Butter the paper and dust the pans with cocoa (you could use flour, but cocoa adds colour and flavour).

1. Measure the cocoa powder into a bowl, and whisk in 1 1/2 cups of boiling water until it is smooth, dark and so glossy it reminds you of chocolate pudding. Whisk in the milk and vanilla. In another bowl, whisk the flour with the baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon salt.

1. Put the butter into the bowl of a stand mixer and beat in the sugars until it is light, fluffy and the color of coffee with cream (about 5 minutes). One at a time, add the eggs, beating for about 20 seconds after each before adding the next. On low speed, beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches and the cocoa mixture in 2, alternating flour-cocoa-flour-cocoa-flour.

1. Pour half of the batter into each pan and smooth the tops. Bake in the middle of the oven until a tester comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes. Let the pans rest on cooling racks for 2 minutes, then turn the cakes onto racks to cool completely before frosting.

1. Make the frosting: Chop the chocolate and melt it in a double boiler. Let it cool so that you can comfortably put your finger in it. While it’s cooling, mix the butter with the whipped cream cheese. Add the chocolate, the vanilla and a dash of salt, and mix in the confectioners’ sugar until it looks like frosting, at least 5 minutes. Assemble the cake, spreading about a third of the frosting on one of the cooled layers, then putting the second layer on top and frosting the assembled cake.

They are very good but also too soft. Almost like a doughnut, probably because of the addition of eggs.

## Basque cheesecake

### Ingredients

Unsalted butter
2 lb Cream cheese (room temperature)
1.5 Cups Sugar
6 large Eggs
2 Cups Heavy cream
1 tsp Kosher salt
1 tsp Vanilla extract
1/3 Cup All purpose flour

### Preparation

1. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Butter pan, then line with 2 overlapping 16x12" sheets of parchment, making sure parchment comes at least 2" above top of pan on all sides. Because the parchment needs to be pleated and creased in some areas to fit in pan, you won’t end up with a clean, smooth outer edge to the cake; that’s okay! Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet.

1. Beat cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl, until very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.

1. Increase speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating each egg 15 seconds before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce mixer speed to medium-low. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.

1. Turn off mixer and sift flour evenly over cream cheese mixture. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, and silky, about 10 seconds.

1. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the center, 60–65 minutes.

1. Let cool slightly (it will fall drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake. Slice into wedges and serve at room temperature, preferably with a glass of sherry alongside.

Cheesecake can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Be sure to let cheesecake sit for several hours at room temperature to remove chill before serving.

## Vanilla Cake

### Ingredients

* 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan
* 3¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan
* 2 cups granulated sugar
* 1 Tbsp. baking powder
* 1 3/4 tsp. kosher salt, divided
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 2 large eggs
* 5 large egg yolks
* 1 1/4 cups buttermilk, room temperature
* 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil
* 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract

### Preparation

1. Place a rack in center of oven; preheat to 325°. Smear room-temperature butter all over bottom and sides of a 13x9" baking dish (metal or glass is okay) with your fingertips. Sprinkle a light dusting of flour into pan, then shake pan to coat all over; tap out excess flour.

1. Whisk 2 cups granulated sugar, 1 Tbsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt, ½ tsp. baking soda, and remaining 3¼ cups flour in a large bowl.

1. Whisk 2 eggs, 5 egg yolks, 1¼ cups buttermilk, 2 Tbsp. oil, and 1 Tbsp. vanilla in a medium bowl until smooth.

1. Cut 2 sticks butter into 1" pieces and add to bowl with dry ingredients. (Now's a good time to make sure your butter is really at room temp—as in, you should be able to make an impression in the butter with your finger. If it's too firm, you won't be able to properly incorporate it into the flour.) Using an electric mixer on low speed, slowly increasing speed to medium, beat until butter is worked into dry ingredients and mixture looks like coarse meal, 4–5 minutes. There shouldn't be any dry flour or visible chunks of butter at this point.

1. Make a well in center of flour mixture and pour in half of buttermilk mixture. Starting on low speed and slowly increasing to medium, beat until all of flour mixture is hydrated.

1. Add remaining buttermilk mixture and beat on low speed until liquid is incorporated. Increase speed to high and beat until mixture is satiny smooth, light, and thick, about 1 minute.

1. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth into corners in an even layer.

1. Bake cake until top is golden brown, firm to the touch, and a tester inserted into center comes out clean, 45–55 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.

## Chocolate Icing

### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
* 6 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
* 2 cups powdered sugar
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* Sprinkles (for serving; optional)

### Preparation

1. Using electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat 6 oz. cream cheese and remaining 1½ sticks butter in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.

1. Add 2 cups powdered sugar, ¼ cup cocoa powder, and remaining ¾ tsp. salt and beat again, scraping down sides of bowl, until completely smooth.

1. Add remaining 1 tsp. vanilla and continue to beat until fluffy and lightened in color, another minute.

1. Smooth icing over top of cooled cake (it should not be at all warm to the touch, or else the icing will melt).

## Sweet Tomatillo tart

### Ingredients (dough)

* 250gr All purpose flour
* 100gr Butter, cubed, cold
* 2 Tbsp water
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 1 pinch salt

### Ingredients (filling)

* 3 Cups (500gr) thinly sliced tomatillos
* 1 1/2 Cups (300gr) sugar
* 3 Tbsp Tapioca
* 4 Tbsp (30gr) chopped pecans
* 1/2 tsp orange zest
* 1 pinch salt

### Preparation (dough)

1. Put the flour on a flat surface and make a well. Add the salt and butter.
1. Incorporate the flour and the butter with your hands. Try to not over-work it so it doesn't warm up.
1. Once the butter has been incorporated form a ball and refrigerate it for 30 minutes.
1.  Take dough out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter for a few minutes to soften slightly for easy rolling. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into an 11-inch circle, then place gently into a 9-inch tart pan. With a sharp knife, trim the edges of the pastry to fit the tart pan. Cover pan with plastic wrap and place in the freezer until firm, about 30 minutes. Frozen dough is less prone to shrinking while baking.

### Preparation (filling)

1. Preheat oven to 425F
1. Hydrate the tapioca with boiling water. Let it rest for 10 minutes.
1. Combine tapioca, tomatillos, sugar, pecans, orange zest and salt.
1. Pour the filling over the dough and bake until the edges are golden brown (about 20 minutes).
1. Serve at room temperature.
