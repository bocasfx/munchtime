## <a id="LentilsAndRice" name="Lentils and Rice"></a> Lentils and Rice

### Ingredients

3/4 C Lentils
1 C Basmati rice
1 Large onion, sliced
1 tsp Baharat
Olive oil
Salt
1 Bay leaf
3/4 tsp Coriander, ground

### Preparation

1. In a heavy bottom pan over medium high heat add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.

1. Add onion with a large pinch of salt. Stir it for a few seconds until it gets covered in oil. Leave untouched for a few minutes until starts browning, then stir and let it brown a bit more. Repeat several times until the onions have browned completely, almost burnt. Be sure not to stir too often or you'll get caramelized onions instead.

1. In a separate pot add four cups of water, 1/2 tsp of salt and bring it to a boil. Add the bay leaf and the lentils. Cook over medium-low heat until the lentils are cooked but not mushy.

1. Strain the lentils and reserve the broth. Put two cups of the broth in a pot and bring it to a boil. Add the rice and cook it covered over low heat.

1. When the rice is done let it rest, covered, for 10 or 20 minutes.

1. In a large pan over medium-low heat add two tablespoons of olive oil. Add the lentils, rice, onions, baharat and coriander. If needed add more salt.

1. Serve with labneh and pita bread.

### Ingredients

* 1 C Basmati rice, unwashed
* 1 Garlic clove, sliced
* 2 C Hot water
* 3/4 tsp Salt
* 2 Plantains, ripe
* Olive oil

### Preparation

1. Add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a pot over medium heat.

1. Lower the heat to medium low and add the garlic. Stir for a couple of minutes. Make sure the garlic does not start to brown.

1. Add the rice and continue stirring until all the rice gets covered in olive oil and it starts to sound like "walking on pebbles" when you stir it.

1. Add the salt and the water. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and let it simmer until the water is consumed.

1. Stir one or two times to make sure that the rice cooks evenly but not stir too much or the rice will get mushy.

1. Once the water is consumed remove from the heat and let it rest covered for twenty minutes.

1. Peel the plantains and cut them in slices about 1/2cm thick.

1. Add enough olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Place the plantains in the pan and let them cook for a few minutes until browned on one side.

1. Use a spatula or a fork to turn them and brown them on the other side. Make sure not to move them too much so they don't fall apart.

1. Once the plantains are done remove them from the pan and place them on a paper towel to absorb the excess oil. Sprinkle them with salt.

1. Serve the plantains on top of the rice.
